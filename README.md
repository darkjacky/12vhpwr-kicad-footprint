# 12vhpwr-kicad-footprint

This is a rough (but it should work) KiCad footprint for the 12V HPWR 10160920-12P4S1LF board connector.<br />
You can get the 3D model here: https://www.amphenol-cs.com/minitek-pwr-hybrid-3-0-header-101609201240100lf.html<br />
The footprint is based on the 3D model. Hopefully the 3D model is correct.

Feel free to improve on this design. Perhaps even pull request it.
